          •	People who have had COVID 19 should still be vaccinated
•	Every person is different when it comes to protection gained from once having COVID 19
•	This virus is new so experts don’t know yet how long natural immunity might last 
CAUSE INFERTILITY?
•	There is no evidence to support this
•	Non have that have been reviewed by the TGA
•	The TGA will not approve anything that isn’t safe and effective
•	This theory comes from a disproven idea that one of the spike proteins in COVID 19 and the Syncytin-1 protein (which help placenta development) are the same, which they are not
•	The vaccines work by training our bodies to develop antibodies to fight against COVID 19 and to prevent future illness
•	There is no evidence suggesting that fertility is a side effect of any vaccine
WILL THE VACCINE WORK IF COVID 19 TURNS INTO MORE?
•	All viruses mutate
