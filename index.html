The COVID 19 virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing, or breathe. 
A person can be infected when droplets containing the COVID 19 virus are inhaled or come into direct contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth. Additionally, a person can get infected through touching surfaces that have been contaminated by the virus when touching their eyes, nose, or mouth without cleaning their hands. 
Evidence shows that the COVID 19 virus spreads mainly between people who have close contact with each other. 
To best avoid getting COVID 19 avoid the three Cs: Crowded places, Close contact settings, Confined and enclosed spaces.

Researchers have worked hard to develop vaccines. The speed of development of the vaccine is a result of collaborations between scientists, manufacturers, and distributors. 
Unlike other situations, planning phases have been run side by side with the vaccine developments, instead of running one after the other. 
Research data has been conducted and collected from other viruses like SARS in 2002 and MERS in 2012, to help provide insight into how Australia should respond to the pandemic. 
The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) assesses the vaccines before they are approved in Australia through multiple phases of testing. The vaccines are assessed on Safety, Quality and Effectiveness. Each batch of the vaccine is quality checked before distributing, making sure each batch meets the same quality requirements. 
Thanks to the community maintaining safe behaviors, like good hand hygiene and social distancing, there has been more time for testing of the vaccines

People have doubts about not being microchipped or being about to connect to the internet after the vaccine process. However, this is not the case. Some of the mRNA vaccines use a material called a hydrogel, which helps to disperse the vaccine slowly through out our cells. 
Bioengineers have used hydrogels as a method to keep stem cells alive after being implanted into our bodies. 
As a result of this people believe that hydrogels are needed for electronic implants which in turns connects to the internet. This is not true. Furthermore, Pfizer does not use hydrogels as a component. So, no software or microchips are contained in the vaccines.

No, the COVID 19 vaccine does not alter your DNA. 
It, however, instructs your body to make an immune response against the COVID 19 virus. 
The COVID 19 mRNA vaccines teach the cell how to make a protein that triggers an immune response against the virus. 
Vaccines work with the body’s natural immune defenses to develop an immunity to disease.

There is no evidence to support that the COVID 19 vaccines causes or has a side effect of infertility. 
In turn, the TGA will not approve anything that isn’t safe and effective. 
This infertility theory comes from a disproven idea that one of the spike proteins in COVID 19 and the Syncytin-1 protein (helps the placenta to develop) are the same, which they are not. 
Vaccines work by training our bodies to develop antibodies to fight against the COVID 19 virus and to prevent future illness.

None of the TGA approved vaccines contain the live virus. In turn, they cannot give you COVID 19. 
There are side effects from the vaccines that mimic symptoms of COVID 19. This is normal and a sign that your body is building an immune protection against the virus. 
The only symptoms that you need to be concerned about are:

All viruses mutate and COVID 19 is no different. This does not however, mean that vaccines will not be effective. 
Evidence shows that the vaccines will still be effective against new strains of the virus. The TGA looks at this as part of their approval and monitoring process. 
There is a possibility of people needing a booster or being vaccinated again annually like the fly vaccine. However, this is still being investigated.

Research is being undertaken to become more informed. Trailed are being conducted to find out if we need a booster vaccine annually or a longer basis. 
The vaccine program is to reduce COVID 19 related harm. Doing this through preventing serious illness and death and as much as possible transmission of the COVID 19 virus that causes disease.
