# ONEPAGE WEBSITE!

This is a basic HTML starter project you can build on however you like. No need to save. While you develop your site, your changes will happen ‚ú® immediately in the preview window. On the left you'll see the files that make up your site, including HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. You can upload assets like images or audio in `assets`. The rest is up to you and your imagination. ü¶Ñ

## What's in this project?

‚Üê `README.md`: That's this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

‚Üê `index.html`: This is the main web page for your site. The HTML defines the structure and content of the page using _elements_. You'll see references in the HTML to the JS and CSS files. Try clicking the image in the center of the page!

‚Üê `style.css`: CSS files add styling rules to your content. The CSS applies styles to the elements in your HTML page. The style rules also make the image move when you click it.

‚Üê `script.js`: If you're feeling fancy you can add interactivity to your site with JavaScript. The code in the JavaScript file runs when the page loads, and when the visitor clicks the button you can add below.

Open each file and check out the comments (in gray) for more info.

# MY NOTES:

## Inspiration on Topic and Website Design:

When picking a topic for my one-page website, I wanted to pick a topic that has been a part of all our lives since the COVID 19 Pandemic started. Researching the facts of the COVID 19 vaccine, gave even myself some clarify that I didn‚Äôt even know that I needed. There were many questions and assumptions established about the COVID 19 vaccine. This encouraged me to answer and provide information on these issues.
I wanted to create a website that was easy to navigate and have all the information provided on the one page without having too many effects. I wanted the experience of my website to reflect and have the same perception as being on health.gov.au and WHO.

## Production:

I first started with creating a navigation bar. This holds all the titles of the questions and information that can be flipped between. This navigation bar is sticky, so it stays in the same position no matter which part of the website is visited. This is to keep user experience easy to understand. I wanted the user to be able to know which part of the website has already been visited, so I added the light blue colour to signify that the user has clicked this button. To add some interaction with the navigation bar, I added the hover features to change the colour and create movement when the user hovers their mouse over the button.
I then added all my information into the website, making sure that the flow of information made sense one after the other. The title block was also added big and bold to first draw the eye. I then added images to support and break up large amounts of text. These images are informational and provide graphical representation for visual learners. The image in the payment section is also a link. I wanted to create an easy quick link that allowed users to have easy access to the eligible calculator. However, I also created a eligible calculator of my own, where you put in your age and it can quickly tell you whether you are eligible or not.  
The last segment is a video that I have sourced into the website for easy user accessibility, that educates the user on more information about the COVID 19 vaccine.
The final touch that I added was a quick movement of words to catch the users‚Äô eyes. The ‚ÄòGet Vaccinated! Protect Yourself and Your Family!‚Äô, was put at the top of the website to entice and remind people that they should vaccinated to protect our future.

## Notes:

- Created buttons using the nav tool and creating links between the subtitles.
- Also created the latest figures buttons with the hidden and reveal message in JavaScript.
- Colour scheme was orange, dark blue, light blue and white, this also reflects the COVID 19 posters that have been circulating.
- Created the age eligibility button with a function to check age in JavaScript. This uses an API that check the conditions that I have set out.
- I created console logs that tell you when the page has been scrolled or when the navigation bar has been clicked or when the movement of letters has been run.
- The text movement on the top of the page was created using a loop that worked through the letters of the word to move each letter to create the movement that you see.
